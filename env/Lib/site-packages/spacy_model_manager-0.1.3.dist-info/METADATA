Command line utility to view, install, and upgrade spaCy models

## Installation

The spacy-model-manager package requires Python 3.7 or newer, and can be installed from PyPI (Python Package Index). Installing with **pip** will automatically install all required dependencies. A selection of environments we have tested follows:

*   Ubuntu 20.04LTS and later releases require build-essential, python3, python3-pip, and python3-venv packages
*   macOS 11 (and newer) releases require Xcode 13 (or newer), Xcode CLI tools, and Python 3 installed using Homebrew (or your preferred method)
*   Windows 10 and Windows 11 releases require Visual Studio Code, Build Tools for Visual Studio, and Python 3 installed using Anaconda 3 (or your preferred method)

We **strongly recommend** you create and activate a Python virtual environment prior to installing spacy-model-manager. With your environment configured and a Python virtual environment created and activated, run the following commands.

Make sure pip is upgraded to the latest version:
```shell
pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install spacy-model-manager:
```shell
pip install spacy-model-manager
```

## CLI introduction

The spacy-model-manager CLI provides a command line interface to determine which spaCy models are currently installed, install additional models, and remove models. To see available commands, type:

```shell
(venv) user@host:~$ spacy-model -h
```

## Model management

New spaCy releases are generally accompanied by newly trained models. Using different versions of models over the same collection may produce different results. Depending on your workflow and needs, you may wish to install earlier versions of models, upgrade models that were previously installed, or install multiple models. The spacy-model command assists with these tasks.

To see a list of available models, type:

```shell
(venv) user@host:~$ spacy-model list
```

To install an available model:

```shell
(venv) user@host:~$ spacy-model install en_core_web_sm
```

To install a specific version of an available model:

```shell
(venv) user@host:~$ spacy-model install en_core_web_sm --model-version 3.1.0
```

Note: requesting a model version that does not match the minor version of the spaCy package installed may result in dependency conflict messages and further errors. A request to install a specific version will replace any existing version of that model, even if the existing version is newer.

To remove an installed model:

```shell
(venv) user@host:~$ spacy-model remove en_core_web_sm
```

To upgrade an installed model:

```shell
(venv) user@host:~$ spacy-model upgrade en_core_web_sm
```
